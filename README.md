# üìã Task List

Welcome to **Task List**, a simple yet powerful task management application built with Angular. This project showcases my skills as a developer and my passion for creating user-friendly and functional web applications.

## üöÄ Features

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, and delete tasks.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Task Reminder**: Set reminders for your tasks.
- **Modal Dialogs**: Add tasks using a modal dialog.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Navigate between different views.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Angular**: Frontend framework for building dynamic web applications.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript for type-safe code.
- **RxJS**: Reactive programming library for asynchronous operations.
- **FontAwesome**: Icon library for adding vector icons.
- **JSON Server**: Mock backend server for development and testing.

## üì¶ Getting Started

### Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### JSON Server

#### What is JSON Server?

JSON Server is a full fake REST API that you can use for prototyping and testing your frontend application without needing to set up a real backend.

#### How to Run JSON Server

1. Start JSON Server::

   ```sh
   npm run server
   ```

2. JSON Server will run on `http://localhost:3000/` by default.

#### How it Works

JSON Server watches the [db.json](./db.json) file and provides a full REST API for the data. You can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the data using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running End-to-End Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
